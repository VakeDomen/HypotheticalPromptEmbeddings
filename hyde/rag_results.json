                    "text": "Caption : Tasmanian berry grower Nic Hansen showing Macau chef Antimo Merone around his property as part of export engagement activities . THE RISE and rise of the Australian strawberry , raspberry and blackberry industries has seen the sectors redouble their international trade focus , with the release of a dedicated export plan to grow their global presence over the next 10 years . Driven by significant grower input , the Berry Export Summary 2028 maps the sectors ’ current position , where they want to be , high-opportunity markets and next steps . Hort Innovation trade manager Jenny Van de Meeberg said the value and volume of raspberry and blackberry exports rose by 100 per cent between 2016 and 2017 . She said the Australian strawberry industry experienced similar success with an almost 30 per cent rise in export volume and a 26 per cent rise in value to $ 32.6M over the same period . “ Australian berry sectors are in a firm position at the moment , ” she said . “ Production , adoption of protected substrate cropping , improved genetics and an expanding geographic footprint have all helped put Aussie berries on a positive trajectory . “ We are seeing a real transition point . Broad industry interest and a strong commercial appetite for export market development combined with the potential to capitalise on existing trade agreements and build new trade partnerships has created this perfect environment for growth. ” High-income countries across Europe , North America and Northern Asia have been identified as having a palate for Australian grown berries with more than 4244 tonnes of fresh berries exported in the last financial year alone . The strategy identified the best short-term prospect markets for the Australian blackberry and raspberry industry as Hong Kong , Singapore , The United Arab Emirates and Canada . The strongest short-term trade options identified for the strawberry sector were Thailand , Malaysia , New Zealand and Macau . The strategy focuses heavily on growing the existing strawberry export market from 4 per cent to at least 8 per cent of national production by volume , in markets with a capacity and willingness to pay a premium for quality fruit . For raspberries and blackberries , the sectors aim to achieve a 5 per cent boost in exports assessed by volume across identified markets by 2021 . Tasmanian raspberry exporter Nic Hansen said Australia offers some of the sweetest and most attractive berries in the world , and this combined with our stringent food safety standards across all stages of the supply chain puts growers in a solid position . “ We have a great product , we are hungry to expand trade and now with this new plan in place , we have a clear roadmap towards driving growth , ” Mr Hansen said ."

And if indeed that was the reason , or one of the reasons , then another unpleasant conclusion imposed itself : inequality in India may be ( far ) higher than implied by NSS data . And indeed , as the graph below shows , NSS kept on producing a fairly stable consumption Gini ( calculated here on household per capita basis ) over several decades , with only a small increase in inequality after India ’ s sharp turn toward capitalism in the early 1990s . That Gini , ranging between mid- and higher-30s , made India inequality look about the same as in developed countries . / > But until recently we had no other reliable and nationally-representative survey to confront NSS with . Now , thanks to the joint work by University of Maryland and National Council of Applied Research in New Delhi , we have ( harmonized by LIS ) , the first income based surveys of Indian population for 2004 and , just released by LIS , another same survey for 2011 . And the results are very different from NSS ’ s . First , Indian Gini is remarkably consistent in both 2004 and 2011 and is ( on per capita basis ) 51 Gini points . This is at the level of Latin American countries and is some 15 points ( or almost 40 % ) higher than the Gini ’ s calculated from NSS . Thus a key question is immediately asked : is India ’ s inequality more like Latin American ? NSS was saying for years that it is not ; the India Human Development Survey ( IHDS ) argues it is . For 2011 , I have both micro data from NSS and micro data from IHDS and when I compare income/consumption by each percentile ( note that these are entirely different people though ) , the results do make sense . For the lowest percentiles , consumption is about twice income , and everybody up to the 33rd percentile consumes more than their income ( which you would expect in a poor environment ) . After that point , consumption consistently and monotonically falls short of income ( that is , there is saving ) , so much that among the top 5 % , income is twice as high as consumption ( saving rate is 50 % ) . Overall , the mean per capita income from IHDS is 47 percent higher than the mean per capita consumption from NSS , and as we have said , Gini is some 15 points higher ."

                    "text": "How unequal is India ? The question is simple , the answer is not . For some 60 years , the only reliable information about India ’ s inequality was coming from the annual National Sample Survey conducted from 1951 . NSS is one of the most venerable surveys in the world of poverty and income distribution statistics . India started fielding it soon after its independence : the survey was supposed to track how the new government fought poverty , to provide information on caste differences , rural-urban gap , caloric intake , especially of the poor and many other statistics . Since its main concern was with poverty , the decision was made to survey consumption , that is , how much people actually consume ( do they have sufficient number of calories ) rather than income ( how many rupees they earn ) . For all these decades since 1951 NSS was the key instrument that allowed researchers from India and the rest of the world as well as Indian policymakers to know what is happening with India ’ s population . India could thus boast to have had a longer series of annual surveys than most rich countries ( that often launched their similar surveys in the 1960s ) . But in addition the survey also benefited from some reflected glory which had to do with the ideals and hopes raised by the Independence and thus it had a bit of this Third World-Bandoeng Summit-Mahalanobis glow always attached to it . But the problems started in the 1990s when the survey numbers began to diverge more and more from National Accounts statistics : NSS was showing consistently lower rates of growth , and higher poverty than many people thought it should be given India ’ s fast growth . This led to the famous Great India Poverty debate in which participated Angus Deaton , Amartya Sen , Jean Drèze , T.N . Srinivasan , S. Subramanian , Martin Ravallion and many others . Several representative articles are given here and here and here . The gap between the slow moving survey mean and much faster changes in per capita GDP was also explained by the failure of NSS to capture top incomes . The top incomes may have been pulling up the mean ( presumably reflected in GDP per capita ) and if surveys continued , partly by design and partly by the reluctance of the rich to participate , to be focused on the bottom of the income distribution , that could explain the rising gap between NSS and national accounts . And if indeed that was the reason , or one of the reasons , then another unpleasant conclusion imposed itself : inequality in India may be ( far ) higher than implied by NSS data ."

These cost savings are equivalent to more than 330 million US $ in Zambia and more than 260 million US $ in Zimbabwe . Support services needed - Supported Self-supply is a service delivery model putting support services in place to improve Self-supply , so it is not about a particular technology . - Supported Self-supply is aligned with the Human Rights to Water and Sanitation , which allows a progressive realisation of the universal access to safe water . However , supported Self-supply is not a way to exempt government from its duties : Government has specific roles to play to ensure that everybody will have access to safe water finally . - To sustain and to take Self-supply to scale there is need for contextualised support as well as long-term engagement , capacity development at all levels , M & E and technical support , reliable funding and learning and sharing . - Interministerial cooperation and champions within government agencies are needed to ensure sustainable embedding and for taking Self-supply further , particularly in remote rural areas . - There is no-one-size-fits-all solution for supported Self-supply – for each programme , it needs a contextualized design and follow-up to achieve desired impact . - Hygiene promotion , including Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage ( HWTS ) , is highly recommended for any non-piped water supply services , including Self-supply water sources . - The huge potential for substantially improving the level of water supply for millions of people in rural areas should be accessed through supported Self-supply .

Project Description UNICEF and Skat have collaborated on a ) . Perspectives Reach and benefits : - Self-supply is practised by millions of rural households in Sub-Sahara Africa as well as in Europe , USA and other areas of the world . - Benefits reported from having access to Self-supply water sources include convenience , less time spent for fetching water and access to more and better quality water . In some areas , Self-supply sources offer important added values such as water for productive use , income generation , family safety and improved food security . - Sustainability of services from Self-supply is high as there is strong ownership by people investing in own sources . - As Self-supply sources are shared sources , many people , including poor and vulnerable households , benefit from investments in Self-supply , often at no costs . This means that Self-supply can be effective in reaching the hard-to-reach . - For millions of people in rural areas of Africa , supported Self-supply will be the most cost effective service delivery model to provide access to safe water . This also includes those parts of the population which actually have poor access as they e.g . can not afford water from communal supplies . - However , in areas where external support for Self-supply is lacking , only marginal improvements can usually be achieved , and the quality of services is lower than in areas where a dedicated support effort was made . Costs and business model for supported Self-supply - In many rural contexts , supported Self-supply is the most cost effective approach for water service delivery . However , as it is not applicable in all contexts , a blended approach combining communal water supply and supported Self-supply models should be followed . - Based on a Life Cycle Cost ( LCC ) analysis of different service delivery approaches , the LCC for communal supplies are about 40 US $ /capita served in the study countries , whereas the LCC for supported Self-supply is about 10 U $ /capita . - In sparsely populated areas , communal supplies ( e.g . handpumps ) are even more costly ( up to 100 U $ /capita served ) as only few people can be served with one additional unit . Serving all rural people with communal supply is therefore not financially viable . - Considering the applicability of Self-supply technologies , in Zambia and Zimbabwe , the cost saving of following a blended approach using both communal supplies and supported Self-supply is almost 50 % of the total LCC for reaching 100 % of the population by 2030 ."

These cost savings are equivalent to more than 330 million US $ in Zambia and more than 260 million US $ in Zimbabwe . Support services needed - Supported Self-supply is a service delivery model putting support services in place to improve Self-supply , so it is not about a particular technology . - Supported Self-supply is aligned with the Human Rights to Water and Sanitation , which allows a progressive realisation of the universal access to safe water . However , supported Self-supply is not a way to exempt government from its duties : Government has specific roles to play to ensure that everybody will have access to safe water finally . - To sustain and to take Self-supply to scale there is need for contextualised support as well as long-term engagement , capacity development at all levels , M & E and technical support , reliable funding and learning and sharing . - Interministerial cooperation and champions within government agencies are needed to ensure sustainable embedding and for taking Self-supply further , particularly in remote rural areas . - There is no-one-size-fits-all solution for supported Self-supply – for each programme , it needs a contextualized design and follow-up to achieve desired impact . - Hygiene promotion , including Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage ( HWTS ) , is highly recommended for any non-piped water supply services , including Self-supply water sources . - The huge potential for substantially improving the level of water supply for millions of people in rural areas should be accessed through supported Self-supply . Some countries have endorsed supported Self-supply as service delivery model , such as Zimbabwe or Sierra Leone , and in Ethiopia , Self-supply is now being scaled up at national level .

In contrast, the IHDS reports an income-based Gini of around 51 points for both 2004 and 2011, placing India's inequality at a level comparable to Latin American countries, and approximately 15 points (or nearly 40%) higher than the Gini coefficients calculated from NSS data.",

We went to the Yankee game Sunday afternoon with our friends Jeff and Marie . As per usual , we ate our share of fun ballpark food , so we ’ ll have a little snack at most for dinner . While Kim has a meeting at the New York Junior League on Monday , Tony will be out for dinner with his buddies , so Kim will be on her own once she gets home . While our dinner plans are different , we ’ ll probably have the same thing for lunch : The New York Times ’ Green Garlic Tabbouleh . Kim made tabbouleh a few weeks go , but this recipes gives things a fun twist by using spring garlic , which is in season right now , but not for much longer . Kim is going to a lecture Tuesday night and Tony will probably end up working late , so we ’ ll either meet up somewhere for dinner or just meet at home and order in . On Wednesday , Tony will be having dinner at a work event , so Kim will be on her own . Again , different dinners , same lunch , in this case The Minimalist Baker ’ s 30-Minute Portobello Mushroom Stir Fry . We ’ ve found that despite Lent being long over , we ’ re still skewing pretty vegetarian/pescatarian , and this dish fits the bill , though Tony may add a little chicken to it to mix things up . Kim will be back at the New York Junior League on Thursday , so Tony will be on his own for dinner . On Friday , we ’ re going to an event organized by Tony ’ s university alumni organization : an exhibit of the works of Robert Ryman to be held at the Dia : Chelsea on West 22nd Street . We ’ ve had a lot of fun at previous alumni events , so we ’ re looking forward to this one . We ’ ll probably grab dinner somewhere near the gallery . We have tickets to the ballet on Saturday , but will probably have dinner at home in the form of Food 52 ’ s Cilantro Lime Salmon Cakes with Chipotle Mayo . If you ’ ve been following our blog for the past few weeks , you might notice that this is the third time we ’ ve had the recipe on our weekly menu .

                    "text": "distribution , that could explain the rising gap between NSS and national accounts . And if indeed that was the reason , or one of the reasons , then another unpleasant conclusion imposed itself : inequality in India may be ( far ) higher than implied by NSS data . And indeed , as the graph below shows , NSS kept on producing a fairly stable consumption Gini ( calculated here on household per capita basis ) over several decades , with only a small increase in inequality after India ’ s sharp turn toward capitalism in the early 1990s . That Gini , ranging between mid- and higher-30s , made India inequality look about the same as in developed countries . / > But until recently we had no other reliable and nationally-representative survey to confront NSS with . Now , thanks to the joint work by University of Maryland and National Council of Applied Research in New Delhi , we have ( harmonized by LIS ) , the first income based surveys of Indian population for 2004 and , just released by LIS , another same survey for 2011 . And the results are very different from NSS ’ s . First , Indian Gini is remarkably consistent in both 2004 and 2011 and is ( on per capita basis ) 51 Gini points . This is at the level of Latin American countries and is some 15 points ( or almost 40 % ) higher than the Gini ’ s calculated from NSS . Thus a key question is immediately asked : is India ’ s inequality more like Latin American ? NSS was saying for years that it is not ; the India Human Development Survey ( IHDS ) argues it is . For 2011 , I have both micro data from NSS and micro data from IHDS and when I compare income/consumption by each percentile ( note that these are entirely different people though ) , the results do make sense . For the lowest percentiles , consumption is about twice income , and everybody up to the 33rd percentile consumes more than their income ( which you would expect in a poor environment ) . After that point , consumption consistently and monotonically falls short of income ( that is , there is saving ) , so much that among the top 5 % , income is twice as high as consumption ( saving rate is 50 % ) . Overall , the mean per capita income from IHDS is 47 percent higher than the mean per capita consumption from NSS , and as we have said , Gini is some 15 points higher ."

Dan Foley , the latest contestant voted off the island , says he watched the first two episodes and realized that he was going to get a villain ’ s edit . But even he seems surprised at how negatively he was portrayed – and how vitriolic the viewer response has been . So what did we miss ? Foley , a 47-year-old postal worker from Maine , was happy to tell us . Okay , there are going to be some tough questions today , but let ’ s start with an easy one : what could you have done differently to keep from going home ? You know , it ’ s easy to be an armchair quarterback . If I had only known that Carolyn had the immunity idol , I would have voted out Sierra . You used your extra vote during the tribal council . Do you think that made you a target ? I said it before : superfans can ’ t do basic math . It made no sense for me to play that vote when there was an odd number of people left . I wanted to play it when there was an even number . And what you didn ’ t see was that Sierra came to me and said that Will was ready to get rid of me . And then during Tribal Council , Will said , “ If Dan has the advantage , he should use it. ” It was the right time to play it . Fair enough . So what was your reaction when you were voted out ? Were you angry at Carolyn ? Look , anyone who walks out of the game with a smile on their face didn ’ t play the game . I left that game with a fever of expletives . They didn ’ t show it , but I was swearing and spitting and seething after my torch was snuffed . I was absolutely furious , calling Mike every name in the book . But I don ’ t wish anyone ill will . Okay , I need to call you out on your statement that flippers never win . They don ’ t . They do . No they don ’ t . Tony Vlachos was a backstabber , not a flipper . Okay , but Vecepia Towery won season 4 and she flipped twice . She flipped to vote out Boston Rob at Final 10 . Then , at Final 9 , she flipped back and took out the Rotu alliance . But did she win ? Yes . She won the million ."

Support services needed - Supported Self-supply is a service delivery model putting support services in place to improve Self-supply , so it is not about a particular technology . - Supported Self-supply is aligned with the Human Rights to Water and Sanitation , which allows a progressive realisation of the universal access to safe water . However , supported Self-supply is not a way to exempt government from its duties : Government has specific roles to play to ensure that everybody will have access to safe water finally . - To sustain and to take Self-supply to scale there is need for contextualised support as well as long-term engagement , capacity development at all levels , M & E and technical support , reliable funding and learning and sharing . - Interministerial cooperation and champions within government agencies are needed to ensure sustainable embedding and for taking Self-supply further , particularly in remote rural areas . - There is no-one-size-fits-all solution for supported Self-supply – for each programme , it needs a contextualized design and follow-up to achieve desired impact . - Hygiene promotion , including Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage ( HWTS ) , is highly recommended for any non-piped water supply services , including Self-supply water sources . - The huge potential for substantially improving the level of water supply for millions of people in rural areas should be accessed through supported Self-supply . Some countries have endorsed supported Self-supply as service delivery model , such as Zimbabwe or Sierra Leone , and in Ethiopia , Self-supply is now being scaled up at national level .

            "response": "Dan Foley, who played Survivor: The Amazon (2003), had mixed feelings about his portrayal on the show. In interviews after the season aired, he mentioned:\n\n1. **Positive Aspects**: He appreciated that the show portrayed him as a strategic player and highlighted his alliance with Jenna Morasca, Rob Cesternino, and Butch Jacobs.\n\n2. **Negative Aspects**:\n   - Foley felt that his intelligence was underestimated by viewers due to his portrayal as a \"surfer dude\" type.\n   - He believed the show edited out many conversations he had about strategy and camp life, focusing more on his interpersonal relationships and physical appearances.\n   - Foley also mentioned that he felt the show emphasized his alliance's \"backstabbing\" nature too much, while they saw themselves as strategic rather than malicious.\n\nIn conclusion, while Dan Foley appreciated some aspects of his portrayal, such as his strategic play being recognized, he also had criticisms about how he was portrayed and what content was left on the cutting room floor.",

Then , a team of editors boil all that footage down to one 44-minute episode . Dan Foley , the latest contestant voted off the island , says he watched the first two episodes and realized that he was going to get a villain ’ s edit . But even he seems surprised at how negatively he was portrayed – and how vitriolic the viewer response has been . So what did we miss ? Foley , a 47-year-old postal worker from Maine , was happy to tell us . Okay , there are going to be some tough questions today , but let ’ s start with an easy one : what could you have done differently to keep from going home ? You know , it ’ s easy to be an armchair quarterback . If I had only known that Carolyn had the immunity idol , I would have voted out Sierra . You used your extra vote during the tribal council . Do you think that made you a target ? I said it before : superfans can ’ t do basic math . It made no sense for me to play that vote when there was an odd number of people left . I wanted to play it when there was an even number . And what you didn ’ t see was that Sierra came to me and said that Will was ready to get rid of me . And then during Tribal Council , Will said , “ If Dan has the advantage , he should use it. ” It was the right time to play it . Fair enough . So what was your reaction when you were voted out ? Were you angry at Carolyn ? Look , anyone who walks out of the game with a smile on their face didn ’ t play the game . I left that game with a fever of expletives . They didn ’ t show it , but I was swearing and spitting and seething after my torch was snuffed . I was absolutely furious , calling Mike every name in the book . But I don ’ t wish anyone ill will . Okay , I need to call you out on your statement that flippers never win . They don ’ t . They do . No they don ’ t . Tony Vlachos was a backstabber , not a flipper . Okay , but Vecepia Towery won season 4 and she flipped twice . She flipped to vote out Boston Rob at Final 10 . Then , at Final 9 , she flipped back and took out the Rotu alliance . But did she win ? Yes . She won the million ."

Overall , the mean per capita income from IHDS is 47 percent higher than the mean per capita consumption from NSS , and as we have said , Gini is some 15 points higher . This “ reasonableness ” of the data , and the absence of discontinuities when comparing income and consumption leads one to believe that it is possible that both NSS and IHDS provide accurate information ( with likely underestimation of top-end consumption and income ) , but that income distribution in India is much more unequally distributed than consumption . So if we compare India with other countries that use income surveys , this is how it looks ( see the figure below ) . India seems slightly more unequal than Brazil , and more egalitarian than only South Africa . There are many other issues that are worth exploring here , in particular if we want to look more carefully at the consistency between the two surveys , but I would like to end by considering the role of the new income survey for India from an unusual angle . As mentioned before , since NSS was the only game in town , all our global poverty and inequality statistics were done using NSS . Now , if we replace NSS with the new income survey as I have done for the global inequality calculation for the year 2011 ( unpublished ) , you may expect that the greater inequality revealed by IHDS would push global inequality up , especially since India is such a populous country . Right ? Wrong . What happens is that global inequality goes down by approximately 1 Gini point since the higher income levels implied by IHDS push Indians toward the middle of the global income distribution and more than offset the contribution to higher global inequality that comes from the stretched-out Indian distribution . Thus , somewhat paradoxically , a global implication of a new , and I think more reasonable , approach of viewing India as a country with Latin American levels of income inequality is that global inequality , as calculated so far , might have been overestimated . In conclusion , more unequal but richer India , makes the world more equal . Note : Only a member of this blog may post a comment ."

Round One : Nelson in his usual Karate style stance keeps out of range of Cummings early strikes . Then he presses into the clinch , but Cummings matches him and they jockey for position . As they break apart Nelson lands a good knee . Nelson lands a right hook . he misses with an overhand . Nelson very relaxed , but he ’ s very alert and continually makes Cumming miss by backing up just enough . A right hand counter lands for Nelson , but then Cummings moves to his back and clinches up . Nelson turns though and then breaks away from the clinch . A head kick is blocked by Cummings . Pace slowed a little now in the final 90 seconds . Cummings leaps in and nelson counters with a punch to the body . More missed shots from Cummings and then he moves into the clinch . Nothing doing and they back up . However , Cummings then comes back in and does finally land a few nice punches while Nelson has his back against the cage . Not for long though as Nelson circles out and that ’ s the final action of the round . Round Two : Nelson biding his time in the opening minute of the second as Cummings continually tries to land strikes , but generally comes up short . however , Cummings does back him up against the cage and unleash a flurry that foces Nelson to clinch . They stay in the clinch for a while trying to gain an advantage , but it ’ s stalemate and they disengage . Not much volume in Nelson ’ s striking so far this round , but he does land a speedy right hand that clearly hits the mark . Certainly better accuracy from him , but a little more offense wouldn ’ t go astray . Again he finds a home for a clinical right hand . He starts to close the distance more now , but remains patient and just snaps off another quick right . Into clinch range and Nelson reaches for a guillotine choke and goes to the mat with it . He fluidly switches on to Cummings back . He lands a few punches and then swiftly locks in a rear-naked choke . Impressive stuff from Nelson in the way he was able to transition so slickly to his dangerous ground game and he forces Cummings to tap with only twelve seconds of the second round remaining ."

Unqualified with Anna Faris Some would look at a celebrity and wonder what a person who probably has everything she wants could ever offer in terms of relationship advice . After all , life ’ s generally a smooth cruise for these superstar types , right ? Actress , model , and author Anna Faris smashes that stereotype and serves up some delightful nuggets of wisdom in the amusingly titled podcast , Unqualified . Anna features celebrity guests on her show , and asks about their personal lives in a way that ’ s both thorough and respectful . She ’ s also refreshingly open and honest , and is quite adept at keeping the mood fun without losing the emotions behind each story shared on the podcast . Confessions of a Terrible Husband with Nick Pavlidis The image of a husband in the proverbial doghouse , forced to spend the night lying on the living room sofa instead of beside his wife , is often played for laughs in pop culture . Author and motivational coach Nick Pavlidis , however , uses that mental image to deliver wise , honest , and hilariously self-deprecating stories revolving around the point when he realized that he was far from the ideal husband he ’ d thought himself to be . Nick tackles an assortment of marital problems with the ease and expertise of a man who has spent one too many nights on a lumpy couch ( and isn ’ t ashamed to admit it ) . On Confessions of a Terrible Husband : Lessons Learned from a Lumpy Couch , he shares his stumbles and challenges as a husband ( which he jestingly calls “ moron purgatory ” ) , infused with advice from qualified relationship experts . And yes , he will gladly help you pronounce his last name properly . Savage Lovecast with Dan Savage The name of this podcast works on so many levels . Not only does author and public speaker Dan Savage host the Savage Lovecast , but the subjects it deals with are also… savage , for lack of a better word . Since 2006 , Dan has been dishing out real talk on dating , sex , and love ( even way before # realtalk or podcasts were a thing ) . Whether it ’ s standard relationship stuff or more taboo topics that would make your parents and grandparents blush , Dan ’ s definitely got something substantial to say , delivered in an unapologetic and entertaining manner . Your Turn ! These five love and relationship podcasts cover most if not all of the bases when it comes to romance , friendships , family , and the other interpersonal aspects of our day-to-day lives ."

What have you discovered long after its time ? This site has been a regular visit of mine since ... 2003 maybe ? and it 's been delightful to see how hard you work to promote bands that might not otherwise get noticed by anyone . At the same time , I absolutely see how the numerical rating bell curve can grow exhausting -- music writing was made to instill pleasure , to be a sprawling manifesto , to be something you want to do . I find if I can write at length about anything , I inevitably end up liking even the things that I might have reservations about . I really look forward to seeing where you go from here . Best ! Aaron What are we gon na do with all these extra 7s we 'll have laying around now ? ? ? ? : ) But seriously , the internet is a better place for this site . Sad to see it go , but I 'm sure Something Excellent will carry the torch proudly . David Sad news , but after reading your blog I can understand where you 're coming from . Thanks for all the recommendations over the few years i 've read your output . almostcool It was fun for awhile , but I simply had to shut down comments as the spam was getting out of control .

Pripo often has guests on his show with very interesting stories to tell . Whether it ’ s a problem with your best buddy , your parents , your neighbor , or even your roommate , Pripo ’ s more than happy to talk about it—and even talk you through it .
